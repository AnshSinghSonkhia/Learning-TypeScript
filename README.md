# Learning TypeScript with React.js

> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript

- TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration to the editor.
- Helps to catch errors early.
- TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript can run. (Browser, Node.js / Dino, and in our apps.)

> Hence, TypeScript is highly trustable.

- TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give us great tooling without additional code.

# Create a React with TypeScript app.

```shell
npm create vite@latest
npm install
npm run dev
```
    - type project name or `.` for current folder.
    - choose `react`
    - choose `typescript`
